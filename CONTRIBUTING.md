It would be so nice of you to help fellow programmers around the world. It does not matter if you are or are not a programmer; it matters that you are willing to help others. :heart:

However, some rules need to be followed to keep this repository updated and linguistically correct.

- **Please write the guide only if you are a speaker of the language. DO NOT USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE** OR ANY OTHER WEBSITE.
- Your folder on a language should be composed of a situation and the necessary phrases. The phrases should be in the form of a table
For example, a typical English phrasebook for a restaurant would be like: 

| English        | Language needed           | Transliteration  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| I want a tea      | I want a tea | I want a ti |
| Thank You      | Thank You      | thank u   |

- Your folder should also include a table listing the necessary vocabulary in that case. For the above mentioned example, it could include tea, bill, waiter etc.
- In your PR, state your language and the situation for which you have written the guide.
- In case of widely spoken languages where syntax changes from region to region like Arabic or French, name your folder as `arabic_egyptian` or `french_european` for example.
